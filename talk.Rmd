## Modeling

(Computational) (Infectious) Disease Modeling

Two main types of models:

1. Compartmental/Mathematical/System Dynamics/ Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Models
2. Agent-Based Models (ABM)

## Compartmental Models

<div class="column-left2">
SIR Models

- **S**usceptible
- **I**nfectious
- **R**ecovered

$$
\begin{align*}
    \frac{dS}{dt} &= -b S(t) I(t)\\
    \frac{dI}{dt} &= b S(t) I(t) - kI(t)\\
    \frac{dR}{dt} &= k I(t)
\end{align*}
$$

## Compartmental Models

<div class="column-left2">

- SIS
- SEIR
- MSIR
- SI(CR)
- Vaccine

</div>
<div class="column-left2">
Pros

- Deterministic
- Overall System Dynamics
- Homogeneous (random mixing)
- Simple, easy to set up

Cons

- Not stochastic
- No individual level behaviors
- No complex interactions

</div>

## Agent-Based Models

- The model is composed of individual 'agents'
- Each agent has a set of rules
- The agents repeat these rules (ticks/cycles)

- Observe complex system dynamics from the bottom-up through **emergence**

## Agent-Based Models

<div class="column-left2">
Pros

- Stochastic
- Consolidate knowledge for agent rules/behaviors
- Heterogeneous

</div>

<div class="column-right2">
Cons

- Needs a lot of data and time to set up
- Harder to get general system dynamics
- Needs a lot of model runs
- Resource-intensive

</div>

## (Duncan) Watts Model

Watts 2002: *A simple model of global cascades on random networks*

- Binary Decisions with Externalities (general contagion model)
    - fads, riots, crime, competing technologies, spread of innovation, conventions, and cooperation
- Probability of a global cascade from a single node
- Local dependencies, fractional threshold, and heterogeneity

## Definitions

- **Cascades**: event of any size triggered by an initial seed
- **Global cascades**: a cascade that occupies a finite fraction of an infinite network. A sufficiently large cascade.
More than a fixed fraction of a large, but finite network.
- **Local dependencies**: agents will incorporate information about its neighbors
- **Fractional threshold**: agents themselves a threshold that determine how it incorporates information from its neighbors
- **Heterogeneity**: every agent is different to varying degree from one another


## Analogy from the paper

Diffution of Innovations:

- Innovators ~ initial seed
- Early adopters ~ vulnerable nodes

- A cascade will occur if innovators are connected to many early adopters (**connectivity**)
- More early adopters, higher chance of innovation, but they need to be connected (**structure**)

## Simulation

- $n$ agents in a network start off with a state of $0$
- Individual agents can only have a state that is either $0$ or $1$
- Each agent has $k$ neighbors
- An agent gets a new state of $1$ if a fraction of its neighbors, $\phi$, are also $1$
    - Otherwise an agent gets a new state of $0$
- During each time step, the population evolves:
    - Update states in random, asynchronous order using the threshold rule
    - Once an agent has a state of $1$, it will stay at $1$ for the remainder of the simulation

<hr>

$\phi$ and $k$ are 2 parameters we can change

## Simulation Parameterization

- $\phi$ and $k$ may be heterogeneous
    - To simplify the simulations, the paper has a homogeneous threshold, $\phi$
- The network is a uniform random graph
- A small seed
- Any pair of nodes is connected with probability $p = \frac{z}{n}$
    - in a uniform random graph, $p_k = $ Poisson distribution
- $n = 10,000$
- 100 random runs of each simulation

## Expand the Watts Model

The Watts model can be used to model any **binary outcome**

From a **public health** and **epidemiology** perspective, 
this outcome can be a particular **behavior or action**.

- I ate a cookie.  Yes/No

However, our decision making process is not that simple.

## Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA)

TRA Health behavior model

- Martin Fishbein and Icek Ajzen 1967
- Behavior is determined by an individual's intention
- Intention comes from an individual's attitudes and social context
- Attitudes and social context originates from a set of beliefs

beliefs $\rightarrow$ (attitudes & social context) $\rightarrow$ intention $\rightarrow$ behavior

## Neural Networks

<div class="column-left2">
- Feed-forward
- **Recurrent**
- Convolutional

<hr>

- Psychological plausible decisions
    - social processes
    - experience/ memory
    - influences/ dynamic

Questions:
- How to summarize the NN Simulation data
- Signal Decomposition/analysis
- Projections (t-sne)

Main Lesson: Running software for non-technical people (shiny?)

## Mass Casualty

- 2014: Mass fatality preparedness among medical examiners/coroners in the United States: a cross-sectional study
    - Robyn RM Gershon, Mark G Orr, Qi Zhi, Jacqueline A Merrill, Daniel Y Chen, Halley EM Riley, and Martin F Sherman
- 2015: Are We Ready for Mass Fatality Incidents? Preparedness of the US Mass Fatality Infrastructure
    - Jacqueline A. Merrill, Mark Orr, Daniel Y. Chen, Qi Zhi, and Robyn R. Gershon

Main Findings: "The sectors in the US mass fatality infrastructure report suboptimal capability to respond.
National leadership is needed..."

Lessons Learned: Data quality governs analysis

## Patterns of Care: Congestive Heart Failure

- "Transition Networks in a Cohort of Patients with Congestive Heart Failure"
- Jacqueline A. Merrill
- Kathleen M. Carley
- Barbara Sheehan

- Looked for patients who had no re-admissions, re-admissions, and multiple re-admissions

Lessons Learned: EHR Data is **really** messy
